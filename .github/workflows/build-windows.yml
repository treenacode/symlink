# .github/workflows/build-windows.yml
#
# This workflow runs on GitHub's free Windows cloud machines.
# It installs your dependencies, builds the .exe with PyInstaller,
# and uploads it as a downloadable "artifact" you can grab from the Actions tab.
#
# HOW TO USE:
#   1. Create a free account at https://github.com
#   2. Create a new repository (can be private)
#   3. Upload these files to the repo root:
#        shortcut.py
#        shortcut.ico
#        shortcut.spec
#        requirements.txt
#        .github/workflows/build-windows.yml   ← this file (keep the folder structure)
#   4. Go to your repo → Actions tab → "Build Windows EXE" → Run workflow
#   5. Wait ~3-5 minutes, then download Shortcut.exe from the Artifacts section
